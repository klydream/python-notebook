(1) add file run.py to easily check the running of flask;
(2) add 
print("blueprints", app.blueprints)
print("url_map", app.url_map)
print("extensions", app.extensions)
to check the modules of app;
and we will find that the user control is by the module flask_security and invenio, Flask is reponsible for webserver, 
and invenio is reponsible for initial of database and forms connecting to user.
(3)I'm going to add some steps to add user data to another database when new user registration and modification of user 
password
(4)Zenodo call flask_security by user_register.html of function "url_for_security('register')"
I add a new function 

@blueprint.route('/signup/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
@anonymous_user_required
def register():
    """Load balancer ping view."""
    if _security.confirmable or request.is_json:
        form_class = _security.confirm_register_form
    else:
        form_class = _security.register_form

    if request.is_json:
        form_data = MultiDict(request.get_json())
    else:
        form_data = request.form

    print(form_data)
    return flask_views.register()
 
 to frontpage views.
 
and modify user_register.html from "url_for_security('register')" to url_for('zenodo_frontpage.register')

and it doesn'g work. I think two '/signup/' is registered to the app.

(5)Change '/signup/' to '/signup_test/'

(6)Flask control file is defined by outer file.
For example:
SECURITY_REGISTERABLE = False
THEME_HEADER_LOGIN_TEMPLATE = 'zenodo_frontpage/header_login.html'
I define in config.py and it's valid
